   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to DSA Templates!
=========================================
Collection of data structures and algos implementations in Python 3 and Rust

.. note::
   You can see code of all functions on this site by clicking on `[source]` as usual in tech docs. 
   Maybe it is not the best approach to show implementations of algos and data structures and I should add more explicit code snippets.
   Hope this website will be useful for your journey in the world of algorithms and data structures.

.. note::
   Rust examples are coming soon...
