   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to DSA Templates!
=========================================
Collection of data structures and algos in Python 3 and Rust

.. note::
   You can see code of all functions in this site by clicking on `[source]` as usual in tech docs. 
   Maybe it is not the best solution for showcase of implementation of variuos algos data structures, but it works for me.
   Hope this website will be useful for your journey in the world of algorithms and data structures.

.. note::
   Rust examples are coming soon...
