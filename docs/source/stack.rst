Stack
=====
Stack is a data structure that allows to store and retrieve elements in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order.
The operations of a stack are:

- `push`: add an element to the top of the stack
- `pop`: remove the top element from the stack
- `peek`: return the top element of the stack without removing it
- `is_empty`: check if the stack is empty

Here are collected selected problems that use stacks as a data structure.
